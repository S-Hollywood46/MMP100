<h1>My Journey In This Class</h1>
<p>This semester seemed to fly right by. I have to say I really enjoyed taking this class and learning all these techiques. This site is a culmination of the projects I worked on. The picture you see below is how I rate the class and the professor who was awesome and helped me when I was having a tough time.

      <h1>What to Expect on This Site</h1>

<p>The "My Collage" page is the digital imaging assignment that I really enjoyed. Prior to this class, I haven't used Photoshop at all. There's still much more for me to learn about it, but I know a lot more than I knew before.</p>
<p>The "I Believe I Can Fly" page will show the storyboard project that led to the animation project. I enjoyed working with animation, and I fully intend to continue learning some animation techniques.</p>

<p>On the "Video & Audio Match Project" page, you will see a short video that has some explanation on it's creation. As a video arts and technology major, this was the project I had the most fun working on. I enjoyed the challenge of creating a story from sound, then figuring out how to create video to match. I thought it was really nice to have the live feedback from professor Young and my fellow classmates.</p>
